# GLaDOS Text-to-speech (TTS) Voice Generator with GUI

a fork of nerdaxic's glados-tts, I just added some simple gui

download the code, run the glados.py (may not work if you don't have all the required modules installed, you can install them with pip install)
put in the message GLaDOS will speak, the output file name (exports as a .wav) and click the button
here is an example
"Hello"

all of the tts code is NOT MINE it belongs to nerdaxic
you can find the original project here:
